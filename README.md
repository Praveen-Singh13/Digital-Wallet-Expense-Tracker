Project No 53:
Digital wallet and expense tracker
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Requirements:

1.Store transaction records using pointers and structures

a structure to hold type of transaction(income or expense), amount, category and merchant
a pointer-structure of dynamic size to hold the transactions collectively

2.Display the current balance and transactions

use for loops to print the transactions and calculate total balance

3.Apply functions for each operations

addTransactions()  //inputs transaction details such as type, amount, etc.
calculateBalance   //calculates total balance and also updates the balance after every transaction
generateReport()   //generates monthly reports and alerts if spending is more than 75% of income

4.Edge case

prompts the user if balance is insufficient and exits the program.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Important:

update the balance after every transaction as failing to do so can lead to code breaking.
